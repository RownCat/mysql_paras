we used to run out commands through the shell but now what we can do is
have a file.sql and we can run out code throught there. 
if we have a new file say file.sql to execute it go to the shell and type
          
          source file.sql;
this runs the file.
NOTE: the file must be in the present working directory. to see that we can type pwd command(outside of sql) in the terminal.
if the file is in the subfolder say paras_db what we can do is:
          
          source paras_db/file.sql;
