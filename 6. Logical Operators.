Not Equal:   !=
Not Like:    SELECT title from books where title NOT LIKE "%er%";
Greater than : >, >=
             Note: if we do SELECT 99>1  it returns 1 if we do 99<1 we get 0 .. UNDERSTAND?
                   SELECT 'a'>='A'   return 1 because case doestnt matter;

LOGICAL AND : && , AND (both can be used.)
            SELECT title from books WHERE released_year>2012 && author_lname="eggers" && author_fname="dave";
Logical AND : ||, OR 

BETWEEN: SELECT title from books where released_year BETWEEN 2003 AND 2007;    
         NOTE: we cannot do  BETWEEN 2003 && 2007, otherwise it will give us error. BETWEEN and AND are paired together so we cant use &&.
         NOTE: it is inclusive 2003 and 2007 also included.
       NOT BETWEEN is also USED.
       
***************** NOTE: While using BETWEEN with DATETIME, DATE or TIme it is importatnt to CAST them to desired data type so that we dont get error.
                  e.g:  HOW To CAST: We cast Date to Datetime.
                  CAST( '2019-09-12' AS DATETIME);
                  SELECT CAST('2019-09-12' AS DATETIME);
                  +--------------------------------+
                  | CAST('2019-09-12' AS DATETIME) 
                  +--------------------------------+
                  | 2019-09-12 00:00:00            |
                  +--------------------------------+
                  
                  
IN and NOT IN :  Instead of doing repetitive OR  we can use IN
SELECT author_fname from books WHERE author_fname IN("JHUMPA","NEIL","DAVE");
+--------------+
| author_fname |
+--------------+
| Jhumpa       |
| Neil         |
| Neil         |
| Jhumpa       |
| Dave         |
| Dave         |
| Dave         |
| Neil         |
+--------------+
NOT IN works in the same way.
SELECT released_year  from books WHERE released_year%2=1;
